# This is the core of the multi-page app logic.

# The `st_navbar` just helps in changing what's displayed *conceptually*
# We need to update `st.session_state.current_page` to then conditionally show content
# or use Streamlit's automatic page switching.

# The `st_navbar` returns the selected page name. We can use this to navigate.
# However, Streamlit's multi-page app feature means we don't *manually* switch pages here.
# The `pages/` directory structure does that.
# The `st_navbar` is more for the *visual* navigation.
# We will handle Login/Logout/Sign Up actions here directly.

# if the `selected_page` matches a filename (e.g., "Home" matches `01_Home.py` if `st.Page("pages/01_Home.py", title="Home")` was used with `st.navigation`)
# Since we are using `st_navbar`, we handle specific actions like Login/Logout here.
